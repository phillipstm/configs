# Name of Project

**Author**: Teresa Phillips
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started

Clone down a front end repo[front-end template repo](https://github.com/codefellows/can-of-books-frontend-template/blob/main/README.md) called `can-of-books-frontend`.

Clone down a backend repo <https://github.com/codefellows/can-of-books-backend-template>

Review the `.gitignore` files to ensure they align with standard content for the repos, and add blank `.env` files, which **must be** in your `.gitignore` so as to not get pushed to GitHub.

Deploy BOTH the front-end and the back-end of your app to the cloud. It won't do much, but check for a proof-of-life indicator that the code is running. Your team will work with these same production deployments throughout the labs in this module.

Update the `README.md` file in each repo with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
